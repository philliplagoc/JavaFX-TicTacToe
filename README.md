# JavaFX-TicTacToe
Created TicTacToe using JavaFX

## How to Play: 
Two players go against each other in a game of TicTacToe, where each player must connect three of their player tokens in a row. The game ends when someone wins, or when the board gets filled up.

### Controls: 
The `NUMPAD` is used for marking tiles. The numbers in each tile corresponds to which number key should be pressed to mark that tile. The UI also displays who's current turn it is.
